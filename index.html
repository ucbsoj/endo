          <p>Endometriosis is a complicated disease that affects more than 175 million women around the world. It occurs when tissue similar to the lining of the uterus grows and metastasizes in other areas in the body. While it isn’t deadly, it hinders women’s lives and puts them through endless cycles of pain and complications that are often dismissed by medical professionals.</p>

          <p>Despite its prevalence, endo remains under researched, underfunded and under reported compared to other diseases. Breast cancer, which affects 3.8 million women in the U.S. received over $3 billion in research funding over the past five years. Endo, on the other hand, affects more than 6.5 million women in the U.S. and received only $50 million over the same time period.</p>
          
          <p>Endo doesn’t only affect cisgender women, but trans and non-binary people as well. There have also been a handful of rare cases of endo in men reported over the past three years. This project uses the term “women” when referring to endo patients because data doesn’t account for trans, non-binary people and men.</p>

          <p>A wonderful serenity has taken possession of my entire soul, like these sweet mornings of spring which I enjoy with my whole heart. I am alone, and feel the charm of existence in this spot, which was created for the bliss of souls like mine. I am so happy, my dear friend, so absorbed in the exquisite sense of mere tranquil existence, that I neglect my talents.</p>

          <p>I should be incapable of drawing a single stroke at the present moment; and yet I feel that I never was a greater artist than now.</p>
